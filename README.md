Suggested possible outline
Very Much Open to Revision 

(insert type of images we want to classify here)

SVM
-do SVM
-show precision/recall
-show plot with decision boundary and classes colored in if this is feasible (it might not be).

PCA techinque
-do PCA
-shwo precision/recall
-plot data along first two principal components 

Convolutional Neural Network  
-do CNN
-show precision/recall (will be 100% for certain datasets)
-show weighted filter from two convilution layers( these are similar to the eigen faces we saw)
-show picture of general architecture of network (The one from the link i sent to Slack I beleive
